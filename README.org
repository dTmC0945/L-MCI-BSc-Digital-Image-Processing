*** Assignments

There will be two (*2*) assignments for this course.

The grade breakdown is as follows:

| DEFINITION            | GRADE (%) |
|-----------------------+-----------|
| Individual Assignment |        40 |
| Group Assignment      |        60 |
| Sum                   |       100 |

*Individual Assignment*

An individual assignment will be given to you to work on. This
assignment will consist of questions pertaining to concepts and image
processing techniques.

The grade breakdown is as follows:

| DEFINITION                    | GRADE (%) |
|-------------------------------+-----------|
| Report Style                  |        15 |
| Q1 - Blurring Filters         |        15 |
| Q2 - Image Channel Analysis   |        10 |
| Q3 - RNG Map Generation       |        10 |
| Q4 - Image Cleaning           |        10 |
| Q5 - Shape Recognition        |        30 |
| Q6 - Image Quality Comparison |        10 |
| Sum                           |       100 |

*NOTE:* The assignment is individual and is not meant to be worked as a
group. Once the code and the work is submitted it will be vetted against
a software to determine if any collusion has occured.

*Group Assignment*

The group assignment focuses on a student defined project which its
presentation will be done in the last 3 sessions of the course. You are
to come up with a group and a project within the first 3 weeks of the
lecture otherwise one will be given to you.

The grade breakdown is as follows:

| DEFINITION   | GRADE (%) |
|--------------+-----------|
| Report Style |        15 |
| Content      |        55 |
| Q & A        |        30 |
| Sum          |       100 |

In report writing students must declare their contribution to the work
and they will be asked regarding their field of work during the Q&A
(i.e., if Student A has worked with blurring filter he may be asked on
why a specific one is chosen and/or the concepts and maths behind the
said filter).

*NOTE:* Students will be graded based on their contribution to the
project and answers during the Q&A, therefore will be graded
individually.

** The Lecture Structure

As it currently is, the lecture covers topic from vision technologies
(i.e., camera, display) to methods in improving/analysing gathered
images. The structure of the lecture is shown below.

** Code Supplement

The Code supplement is a Github webpage dedicated to hosting all the
relevant code used in the lecture as it is not feasible to fit all the
content of the code to the slides and it is easier to share this way.
