** Lecture Information

- The goal of this lecture is to introduce you to image processing
  and its wide applications in industry
- We shall have a wide focus on the technologies and the methods
  which make image processing an essential discipline for engineers.

** Grading of the Lecture

    
- The lecture will have a single personal assignment comprising of a set list of
  questions which you can use programing languages to solve on your own.

- There will also be a group assingment where you will team up with your classmates
  to come up with ideas for applying image processing concepts to problems. 
  
| ASSIGNMENT TYPE     | VALUE |
| Personal Assignment |    40 |
| Final Exam          |    60 |
| SUM                 |   100 |
